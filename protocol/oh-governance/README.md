# Oh! Governance

Oh! Finance utilizes a Proposer-Executor model to enact network proposals and modify the protocol. Any changes to the protocol must first be proposed and voted on in the Proposer contract. If a proposal is successful, then actions can be queued up and executed by the Executor contract.

## Contracts

* [Oh! Forum](oh-forum.md) - Proposer contract that records user proposals and votes
* [Oh! Governor](oh-governor.md) - Executor contract that queues and executes successful proposals
