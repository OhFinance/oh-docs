# Oh! Strategy

Each `OhStrategy` contract contains logic to invest an `underlying` token in the associated DeFi protocol and compound any earned rewards. Strategies can be used by a Bank after being added by Governance.

Users do not directly interact with Strategies, as the Bank associated will perform all necessary interactions.
