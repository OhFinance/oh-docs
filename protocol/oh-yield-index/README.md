# Oh! Yield Index

Users interact with Oh! Finance and earn yield by depositing underlying tokens to a Bank. Each Bank has a set of Strategies that interact with individual DeFi protocols, such as Aave, Compound, or Curve. This set of Strategies forms a **Yield Index** which returns the average APY earned across all associated protocols.
