## Description

Curve is a decentralized, Automated Market Maker (AMM) protocol that allows users to swap stablecoins with minimal fees and slippage. Curve uses advanced bonding curves to "aggregate" liquidity around a pegged value to incentivize trading that brings token price closer to the peg.

Curve also offers Gauges, where users can stake their Curve LP tokens to earn the native Curve (CRV) token. CRV tokens can be time-locked to earn protocol voting rights and trading fee revenue for the duration of the lock.
