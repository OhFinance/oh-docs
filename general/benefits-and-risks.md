# Benefits & Risks

## Benefits

Aggregating capital across multiple protocols via yield index passes several benefits on to the protocol users:

* **Increased Volume Exposure** - Interest rates and volumes across DeFi protocols constantly change based on market conditions. Using a yield index allows depositors to experience normalized returns over the long-term.
* **Reduced Smart Contract Risk** - All users undergo risk when depositing to a decentralized protocol; If the protocol is hacked or exploited, the user could lose funds. By using a yield index, risk is more clearly defined and losses are mitigated to a fraction of total capital.

## Protocol Risks

* **Smart Contract Risk** - While the goal of the protocol's yield indexes are to reduce Smart Contract risk, depositors could still lose some or all funds if underlying protocols' contracts or Oh! Finance's own contracts were exploited.
