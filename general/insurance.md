Users can choose a dollar amount and time period to insure, then automatically get quoted for coverage. In the event of a protocol exploit, covered users can then submit claims to Bridge Mutual and receive compensation for any incurred losses.

More information about how you can insure your Oh! Finance position with Bridge Mutual coming soon.
