## Insurance

Oh! Finance is proud to partner with **Bridge Mutual**, an on-chain insurance underwriter, to offer protocol users the option to insure their positions.

Users can choose a dollar amount and time period to insure, then automatically get quoted for coverage. In the event of a protocol exploit, covered users can then submit claims to Bridge Mutual and receive compensation for any incurred losses.

More information about how you can insure your Oh! Finance position with Bridge Mutual coming soon.

## Protocol Guardian

Under extreme circumstances which require administrative intervention, the Protocol Guardian can assume limited admin capabilities to pause a given Bank and/or Strategy. All deposits to a paused Bank are suspended and all underlying tokens are withdrawn from any affected Strategies to allow user withdrawal. Users maintain the rights to withdraw underlying at any time.

Protocol Guardian rights are currently held by the **Oh! Finance Deployer**.
