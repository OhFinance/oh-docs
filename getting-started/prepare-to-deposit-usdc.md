# Prepare to Deposit USDC

## **How to Prepare to stake USDC on Ethereum** <a href="#9c24" id="9c24"></a>

* If you are not using MetaMask yet, here is a guide on getting started: [https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531-Getting-started-with-MetaMask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531-Getting-started-with-MetaMask)
* The Ethereum network is configured by default in MetaMask. Make sure to have enough ETH in your MetaMask wallet to cover transaction fees
* Deposit USDC in your MetaMask wallet or exchange assets to USDC on Uniswap or Sushiswap for example.
* Go to the OH! Finance dApp at [https://oh.finance/](https://oh.finance/). Enter the amount of USDC you would like to deposit or click max if you want to deposit all of it. Next, wait for the MetaMask window to pop up, and approve the transaction. That’s it! It’s that easy. Two clicks and you’re ready to make your money grow with OH!

After the launch of **Phase 1** this is what you will see running on the Ethereum network.
