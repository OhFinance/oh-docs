## Option 1 - Install Metamask

Metamask is probably the most popular DeFi wallet on the market. It is well-respected and has a strong set of features for interacting with DeFi projects.

Save your 12-word phrase in a safe place. General guidance is to write it on pen & paper and put it in a safe or safety deposit box. Anyone that gains access to these 12 words can get access to all of your funds.

## Option 2 - Install Trust Wallet

The second-most popular Wallet app is called Trust Wallet. It can be downloaded from the Google Play store or the iOS App Store.

 Note: if you've already installed Metamask, you do not need to install Trust Wallet. It's recommended to only use one or the other.
